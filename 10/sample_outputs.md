## Notes

- The application uses OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini with function calling to extract structured filters from natural language queries
- Filters can include: category, price range (min/max), rating threshold, and stock availability
- The output format shows: product name, price, rating, and stock status
- When no products match the criteria, a clear "No products found" message is displayed
- The extracted filters are shown for transparency, demonstrating how the AI interprets the natural language query
