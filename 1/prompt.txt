Use Chain-of-Thought to explain how youâ€™d solve this task:
You are selecting a database for a new application. You have the following requirements:
1. Social platform with millions of users
2. Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users
3. High data read speed required
4. Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations
5. Scalability is important as the user base grows

Walk me through your reasoning for why one database is better than another database.
